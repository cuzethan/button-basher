Hello! Welcome to our game Button Basher! Here I will show you a few simple steps to run this game!

## Steps

1. **IMPORTANT**! Make sure your python version is 3.11 or under
2. Download this repository or get the files directly to your preferred directory
3. Run "pip install arcade" in the terminal (if there are issues, check your python version!)
4. cd into your project, there should be three directories (logic, assets, views), and a main.py file
